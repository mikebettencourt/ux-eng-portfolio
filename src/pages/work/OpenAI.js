                    During an innovation sprint, I wanted to brush up on my responsive design skills. Like any
                    developer would, I went to YouTube and found a tutorial for the topic. This landing page is built
                    using React and CSS with the primary focus being CSS Flexbox. This tutorial was particulalry 
                    intresting since I referencing a Figma file for the design, mimicking the Product Designer
                    and Developer relationship.
